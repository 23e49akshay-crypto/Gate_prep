🧠 Topic: Trees (Graph Theory)

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Tree?

A tree is a graph that is:

Connected

Acyclic (no cycles)

📌 Most important identity (PYQ FAVORITE):
If a tree has n vertices, then it has exactly:

𝑛
−
1
 edges
n−1 edges

✔️ If either condition fails → not a tree

🔹 Equivalent Definitions of Tree (VERY IMPORTANT)

For a graph with n vertices, the following are equivalent:

Connected and acyclic

Connected with n−1 edges

Acyclic with n−1 edges

Exactly one simple path between every pair of vertices

📌 GATE Trap:
Questions often ask which condition is sufficient.

🔹 Rooted Tree

A rooted tree has:

One designated node called root

Direction away from the root (implicit)

Terms:

Parent

Child

Leaf (external node) → no children

Internal node → at least one child

Level / Height / Depth

🔹 Degree in Trees

Degree of a node = number of children

Degree of tree = maximum degree of any node

🔹 Binary Tree (HIGH WEIGHTAGE)

A binary tree is a rooted tree where:

Each node has at most 2 children

Left child & Right child are distinguished

🔹 Types of Binary Trees
1️⃣ Full Binary Tree

Every node has 0 or 2 children

2️⃣ Complete Binary Tree

All levels filled except possibly last

Last level filled from left to right

📌 Used heavily in Heaps

3️⃣ Perfect Binary Tree

All internal nodes have 2 children

All leaves at same level

🔹 Important Binary Tree Properties (PYQ GOLD)

If a binary tree has:

n₀ leaves

n₂ nodes with 2 children

Then:

𝑛
0
=
𝑛
2
+
1
n

+1

📌 Extremely common GATE formula

🔹 Height of Binary Tree

Maximum number of edges from root to a leaf

For a binary tree of height h:

Max nodes = 2^{h+1} − 1

Min nodes = h + 1

🔹 Spanning Tree

A spanning tree of a graph:

Includes all vertices

Is a tree

Has exactly n−1 edges

📌 GATE Favorite:
Connected graph may have multiple spanning trees
