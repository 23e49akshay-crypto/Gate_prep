📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Graph Isomorphism & Graph Matrices

PART 1️⃣ – Graph Isomorphism
🔹 What is Graph Isomorphism?

Two graphs G₁(V₁,E₁) and G₂(V₂,E₂) are isomorphic if:

There exists a bijection

𝑓:𝑉1→𝑉2f:V1	​→V2
	​


Such that:

(𝑢,𝑣)∈𝐸1  ⟺  (𝑓(𝑓()∈𝐸2(u,v)∈E1	​

⟺(f(u),f(v))∈E
2
	​


📌 Meaning:
Graphs are structurally identical, just labels differ.

🔹 Necessary Conditions for Isomorphism (PYQ FAVORITE)

If two graphs are isomorphic, they must have:

Same number of vertices

Same number of edges

Same degree sequence

Same number of connected components

Same number of cycles of each length

📌 Important:
These are necessary but NOT sufficient.

🔹 Degree Sequence Check (Very Common)

Sort vertex degrees in non-decreasing order.

If degree sequences differ → NOT isomorphic.

If same → further checking required.

🔹 Quick GATE Tricks

✔ Check:

Degree pattern

Number of triangles

Number of pendant vertices

Adjacency relationships

📌 GATE Trap:
Same degree sequence ≠ automatically isomorphic.

PART 2️⃣ – Graph Matrices
🔹 1️⃣ Adjacency Matrix

For graph with n vertices:

n × n matrix

A[i][j] = 1 if edge exists, else 0

For undirected graph:

Matrix is symmetric.

For simple graph:

Diagonal entries = 0.

🔹 Important Property

Number of edges in undirected graph:

12∑𝐴[𝑖][𝑗]21
	​

∑A[i][j]
🔹 2️⃣ Incidence Matrix

n × m matrix (n vertices, m edges)

Entry = 1 if vertex incident to edge

For directed graph:

−1 (tail), +1 (head)

🔹 3️⃣ Degree Matrix

Diagonal matrix where:

D[i][i] = degree of vertex i

🔹 4️⃣ Laplacian Matrix (Very Important)
𝐿
=
𝐷
−
𝐴
L=D−A

Where:

D = degree matrix

A = adjacency matrix

📌 Used in:

Connectivity

Spanning trees (Kirchhoff’s theorem)

🔹 Important Matrix Results (PYQ GOLD)

A² gives number of walks of length 2

Aᵏ gives number of walks of length k

📌 Walks, not paths (big trap).
