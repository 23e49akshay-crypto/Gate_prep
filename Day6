📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Graph Theory – Basics of Graphs

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Simple, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Graph?

A graph G is an ordered pair:

𝐺=(V,E)
G=(V,E)

V → Set of vertices (nodes)

E → Set of edges (connections)

✔️ Example:
V = {1,2,3}
E = {(1,2), (2,3)}

🔹 Types of Graphs (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Undirected Graph

Edges have no direction

(u,v) = (v,u)

✔️ Example: friendship graph

2️⃣ Directed Graph (Digraph)

Edges have direction

(u,v) ≠ (v,u)

✔️ Example: one-way road

3️⃣ Simple Graph

No self-loop

No multiple edges

📌 GATE Trap:
If multiple edges exist → not simple

4️⃣ Multigraph

Multiple edges allowed

Self-loops may exist

🔹 Degree of a Vertex
In Undirected Graph:

Degree(v) = number of edges incident on v

Self-loop contributes 2

📌 GATE Favorite Trap

In Directed Graph:

In-degree → incoming edges

Out-degree → outgoing edges

📌 Important Property:

∑
in-degree
=
∑
out-degree
=
∣
𝐸
∣
∑in-degree=∑out-degree=∣E∣
🔹 Handshaking Lemma (PYQ FAVORITE)

For undirected graph:

∑
degrees of all vertices
=
2|E|
∑degrees of all vertices=2∣E∣

📌 Important Result:

Number of vertices with odd degree is always even

🔹 Special Graphs
✅ Complete Graph (Kₙ)

Every pair of vertices connected

Number of edges:

∣E|=n(n-1)2∣E∣=2
n(n−1)
	​

✅ Null Graph

Vertices exist

No edges

✅ Regular Graph

All vertices have same degree

🔹 Path, Walk, Trail, Cycle (VERY CONFUSING – GATE TRAP)
Term	Meaning
Walk	Vertices & edges can repeat
Trail	Edges not repeated
Path	Vertices not repeated
Cycle	Closed path

📌 Most common GATE mistake:
Path ≠ Walk

🔹 Connected Graph

A graph is connected if a path exists between every pair of vertices

🔹 Subgraph

A graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of another graph.
