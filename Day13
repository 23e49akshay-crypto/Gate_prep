🧠 Topic: Recurrence Relations

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Recurrence Relation?

A recurrence relation defines a sequence where:

𝑎
𝑛
 depends on previous terms
a
n
	​

 depends on previous terms

Example:

𝑎𝑛=𝑎𝑛−1+2an	​=an−1	​+2

📌 Used heavily in:

Algorithm analysis

Divide & Conquer

DP

🔹 Types of Recurrence Relations
1️⃣ Linear Recurrence

Form:

𝑎𝑛=𝑐1𝑎𝑛−1+𝑐2𝑎𝑛−2+...+𝑐𝑘𝑎𝑛−𝑘an	​=c1	​an−1	​+c2	​an−2	​+...+ck	​an−k
	​

2️⃣ Homogeneous Recurrence

No extra term.

Example:

z𝑛=2𝑎𝑛−1an	​=2an−1
	​

3️⃣ Non-Homogeneous Recurrence

Has extra function term.

Example:

𝑎𝑛=2𝑎𝑛−1+3an
	​=2an−1+3
🔹 Solving Linear Homogeneous Recurrence
Step 1: Characteristic Equation

If:

𝑎𝑛=𝑟𝑎𝑛−1an	​=ran−1
	​


Assume:

𝑎𝑛=𝑥𝑛an	​=xn

Solve for x.

Example:
𝑎𝑛=2𝑎𝑛−1an	​=2an−1
	​


Characteristic equation:

z=2
x=2

Solution:

𝑎𝑛=𝐶(2𝑛)an	​=C(2n)
🔹 Distinct Roots Case

If:

𝑎𝑛=𝑎𝑛−1+𝑎𝑛−2an	​
=a
n−1
	​

+a
n−2
	​


Characteristic equation:

𝑥2=𝑥+1x2
=x+1

Solve quadratic.

General solution:

𝑎𝑛=𝐴𝑟1𝑛+𝐵𝑟2𝑛an	​=Ar1n	​+Br2n
	​

🔹 Repeated Roots Case

If root r repeated k times:

𝑎𝑛=(𝐴+𝐵𝑛+𝐶𝑛2+...)𝑟𝑛an
	​
=(A+Bn+Cn2+...)rn

📌 Very common GATE trap.

🔹 Non-Homogeneous Recurrence

General solution =
Complementary solution + Particular solution

𝑎𝑛=𝑎𝑛(𝑐)+𝑎𝑛(𝑝)an	​=an(c)	​+an(p)	​

🔹 Master Theorem (Algorithm Link)

For:

𝑇(𝑛)z𝑎𝑇(𝑛/𝑏)+𝑓(𝑛)
T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n)

Compare f(n) with:

𝑛log⁡𝑏𝑎nlogb	​a

📌 Very important in GATE Algorithms.

🔹 Important GATE Traps
