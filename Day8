📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Euler & Hamiltonian Paths (Graph Theory)

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Euler Path & Euler Circuit

An Euler path is a path that:

Traverses every edge exactly once

Vertices may repeat

An Euler circuit (Euler cycle):

Is an Euler path

Starts and ends at the same vertex

📌 Edges matter, not vertices (BIG GATE TRAP)

🔹 Conditions for Euler Graph (UNDIRECTED)

Let G be a connected undirected graph.

✅ Euler Circuit exists iff:

All vertices have even degree

✅ Euler Path (but not circuit) exists iff:

Exactly two vertices have odd degree

❌ No Euler Path:

More than 2 odd-degree vertices

📌 PYQ FAVORITE:
Count odd-degree vertices first.

🔹 Euler Path in Directed Graph

For a directed graph:

✅ Euler Circuit:

In-degree(v) = Out-degree(v) for every vertex

✅ Euler Path (not circuit):

One vertex: out-degree = in-degree + 1 (start)

One vertex: in-degree = out-degree + 1 (end)

All others: in-degree = out-degree

🔹 Hamiltonian Path & Circuit

A Hamiltonian path:

Visits every vertex exactly once

A Hamiltonian circuit:

Hamiltonian path that is closed

📌 Vertices matter, not edges (OPPOSITE of Euler)

🔹 Key Differences (VERY IMPORTANT)
Euler	Hamilton
Covers all edges	Covers all vertices
Vertices may repeat	No vertex repetition
Easy necessary & sufficient conditions	No general test
Degree-based	Structural

📌 GATE Trap:
Students mix up conditions.

🔹 Important Theorems (For Hamiltonian)

These are sufficient, not necessary.

1️⃣ Dirac’s Theorem

If a simple graph with n ≥ 3 vertices has:

degree
(v)≥𝑛2∀𝑣
degree(v)≥2n	​∀v
→ Graph is Hamiltonian

2️⃣ Ore’s Theorem

For every non-adjacent vertices u, v:

𝑑𝑒𝑔(𝑢)+𝑑𝑒𝑔(v)≥𝑛
deg(u)+deg(v)≥n

→ Graph is Hamiltonian

📌 GATE asks to apply, not prove

🔹 Common GATE Traps

Euler → count degrees

Hamilton → check structure

Euler conditions are necessary & sufficient

Hamilton conditions are only sufficient
