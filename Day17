📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Linear Algebra
🧠 Topic: Eigenvalues, Eigenvectors & Diagonalization

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Eigenvalue & Eigenvector

For a square matrix A:

A non-zero vector x is an eigenvector if:

𝐴
𝑥
=
𝜆
𝑥
Ax=λx

Where:

λ → eigenvalue

x ≠ 0

🔹 Characteristic Equation

Eigenvalues are found by solving:

∣
𝐴
−
𝜆
𝐼
∣
=
0
∣A−λI∣=0

This gives a polynomial of degree n (for n×n matrix).

🔹 Key Properties (Very Important)

1️⃣ Sum of eigenvalues = Trace(A)
2️⃣ Product of eigenvalues = det(A)
3️⃣ If A is triangular → eigenvalues = diagonal elements
4️⃣ If A symmetric → eigenvalues are real
5️⃣ If λ is eigenvalue of A, then 1/λ is eigenvalue of A⁻¹

🔹 Eigenvectors

After finding λ, solve:

(
𝐴
−
𝜆
𝐼
)
𝑥
=
0
(A−λI)x=0

This gives eigenvectors.

🔹 Algebraic vs Geometric Multiplicity

Algebraic multiplicity → times λ appears as root

Geometric multiplicity → dimension of eigenspace

Important:

1≤GM≤AM
🔹 Diagonalization

Matrix A is diagonalizable if:

𝐴
=
𝑃
𝐷
𝑃
−
1
A=PDP
−1

Where:

D → diagonal matrix of eigenvalues

P → matrix of eigenvectors

Condition:
Matrix must have n linearly independent eigenvectors.

🔹 When is Matrix NOT Diagonalizable?

If:

Geometric multiplicity < Algebraic multiplicity

📌 Very common GATE question.

🔹 Orthogonal Diagonalization

If A is symmetric:

𝐴
=
𝑄
𝐷
𝑄
𝑇
A=QDQ
T

Where Q is orthogonal.

🔹 Cayley-Hamilton Theorem

Every matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation.
