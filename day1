📘 Today’s Learning – Day 1 (GATE CSE 2027)

📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Propositional Logic

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Simple & GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Proposition?

A proposition is a declarative statement that is either TRUE or FALSE, but not both.

✔️ Examples:

“7 is a prime number” → TRUE

“2 + 2 = 5” → FALSE
❌ Not propositions:

Questions, commands, open statements (e.g., x > 5)

🔹 Logical Connectives (Very Important for GATE)
Symbol	Name	Meaning
¬p	NOT	Negation
p ∧ q	AND	True if both are true
p ∨ q	OR	True if at least one is true
p → q	Implication	False only when p=T, q=F
p ↔ q	Biconditional	True when both same

📌 GATE Trap:

Students often think p → q means “q causes p” ❌

Actually, only false when p is true and q is false

🔹 Truth Table (Core Skill)

You must be able to construct truth tables quickly for:

Implication

Biconditional

Compound propositions

🔹 Tautology, Contradiction, Contingency

Tautology: Always TRUE

Contradiction: Always FALSE

Contingency: Sometimes true, sometimes false

🔹 Important Logical Laws (Frequently Asked)

De Morgan’s Laws

¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p ∨ ¬q

¬(p ∨ q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q

Implication Removal:

p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q
