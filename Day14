📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Pigeonhole Principle

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Basic Pigeonhole Principle (PHP)

If:

n objects are placed into m boxes

n > m

Then:
👉 At least one box contains at least 2 objects

📌 Simple but extremely powerful.

🔹 Generalized Pigeonhole Principle

If:

n objects are placed into m boxes

Then:
👉 At least one box contains:

⌈
𝑛
𝑚
⌉
⌈
m
n
	​

⌉

objects

(ceiling function)

🔹 Why It Works?

Because average number of objects per box is:

𝑛
𝑚
m
n
	​


So at least one box must have ≥ ceiling value.

🔹 Common GATE Patterns

Minimum number to guarantee repetition

Remainder problems

Birthday-type problems

Graph theory degree arguments

🔹 Classic Applications
1️⃣ Minimum people to guarantee same birthday?

There are 365 possible birthdays.

To guarantee at least 2 share birthday:

365
+
1
=
366
365+1=366
2️⃣ Remainder Example

Among 6 integers, at least two have same remainder when divided by 5.

Why?
Possible remainders: 0,1,2,3,4 (5 boxes)

6 numbers → at least two share remainder.

🔹 Stronger Version (Important)

If n items placed in m boxes, then:

At least one box has

𝑘
+
1
 items if 
𝑛
>
𝑘
𝑚
k+1 items if n>km
🔹 Common GATE Traps

Forgetting ceiling

Mixing minimum guarantee vs possibility

Overthinking simple distribution
