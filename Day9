🧠 Topic: Graph Coloring & Planar Graphs

PART 1️⃣ – Graph Coloring
🔹 What is Graph Coloring?

Graph coloring means assigning colors to vertices such that:

No two adjacent vertices have the same color.

📌 This is called Proper Vertex Coloring.

🔹 Chromatic Number (χ(G)) — VERY IMPORTANT

The minimum number of colors required to properly color a graph is called the chromatic number.

Examples:

Complete graph 
𝐾𝑛Kn
	​

 → χ(G) = n

Bipartite graph → χ(G) = 2

Tree (n ≥ 2) → χ(G) = 2

📌 GATE Trap:
A graph with no edges → χ(G) = 1

🔹 Important Results
1️⃣ Bipartite Graph

Vertices can be divided into 2 disjoint sets

No edges within same set

χ(G) = 2 (if at least one edge exists)

📌 A graph is bipartite iff it has no odd cycle

2️⃣ Complete Graph
𝜒(𝐾𝑛)=𝑛χ(Kn	​)=n

Every vertex connected to every other.

3️⃣ Cycle Graph 
𝐶𝑛Cn
	​


If n is even → χ(G) = 2

If n is odd → χ(G) = 3

📌 Very common PYQ.

🔹 Coloring Applications (GATE Perspective)

Scheduling problems

Register allocation

Map coloring

PART 2️⃣ – Planar Graphs
🔹 What is a Planar Graph?

A graph is planar if it can be drawn on a plane without edge crossings.

📌 Important:
Edges may cross in drawing but if can be rearranged to avoid crossing → planar.

🔹 Euler’s Formula (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT)

For connected planar graph:

𝑉
−
𝐸
+
𝐹
=
2
V−E+F=2

Where:

V = vertices

E = edges

F = faces

📌 This formula is heavily tested.

🔹 Important Inequalities

For simple connected planar graph with V ≥ 3:

𝐸
≤
3
𝑉
−
6
E≤3V−6

If graph has no triangles:

𝐸≤2𝑉−4
E≤2V−4

📌 GATE Trick:
Use inequality to prove non-planarity.

🔹 Non-Planar Graphs (VERY IMPORTANT)

Two fundamental non-planar graphs:

𝐾5K5
	​


𝐾3,3K
3,3
	​


If a graph contains either as a subdivision → non-planar.

🔹 Faces in Planar Graph

Using Euler’s formula:

𝐹=𝐸−𝑉+2
F=E−V+2
🔹 Maximum Regions Formed by Edges

With n vertices in planar graph:
Max edges = 3n − 6
