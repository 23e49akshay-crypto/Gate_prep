📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Propositional Logic

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Simple & GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Proposition?

A proposition is a declarative statement that is either TRUE or FALSE, but not both.

✔️ Examples:

“7 is a prime number” → TRUE

“2 + 2 = 5” → FALSE
❌ Not propositions:

Questions, commands, open statements (e.g., x > 5)

🔹 Logical Connectives (Very Important for GATE)
Symbol	Name	Meaning
¬p	NOT	Negation
p ∧ q	AND	True if both are true
p ∨ q	OR	True if at least one is true
p → q	Implication	False only when p=T, q=F
p ↔ q	Biconditional	True when both same

📌 GATE Trap:

Students often think p → q means “q causes p” ❌

Actually, only false when p is true and q is false

🔹 Truth Table (Core Skill)

You must be able to construct truth tables quickly for:

Implication

Biconditional

Compound propositions

🔹 Tautology, Contradiction, Contingency

Tautology: Always TRUE

Contradiction: Always FALSE

Contingency: Sometimes true, sometimes false

🔹 Important Logical Laws (Frequently Asked)

De Morgan’s Laws

¬(p ∧ q) = ¬p ∨ ¬q

¬(p ∨ q) = ¬p ∧ ¬q

Implication Removal:

p → q ≡ ¬p ∨ q

📌 GATE Favorite: Convert implication → OR before solving.

2️⃣ Practice: 30 GATE-Level MCQs
Q1.

If p is TRUE and q is FALSE, what is the value of (p → q)?
Answer: FALSE
Explanation: Implication is false only when p=T and q=F.

Q2.

Which of the following is a tautology?
A) p ∧ ¬p
B) p ∨ ¬p
C) p → ¬p
D) ¬(p ∨ q)

Answer: B
Explanation: Law of excluded middle — always true.

Q3.

¬(p ∧ q) is logically equivalent to:
Answer: ¬p ∨ ¬q
Explanation: Direct application of De Morgan’s law.

Q4.

If p ↔ q is TRUE, then:
Answer: p and q have same truth value
Explanation: Biconditional is true when both match.

Q5.

Which is NOT a proposition?
A) 5 > 3
B) x + 2 = 5
C) Earth is round
D) 7 is odd

Answer: B
Explanation: Depends on variable x → not fixed truth value.

Q6.

p → q is equivalent to:
Answer: ¬p ∨ q
Explanation: Standard implication elimination.

Q7.

Which is a contradiction?
Answer: p ∧ ¬p
Explanation: Cannot be true simultaneously.

Q8.

If p = F, q = T, then p → q = ?
Answer: TRUE
Explanation: Implication true when antecedent is false.

Q9.

Truth value of (p ∨ q) ∧ ¬p when p=F, q=T?
Answer: TRUE
Explanation: (F∨T)=T and ¬F=T → T∧T=T.

Q10.

Which law converts ¬(p ∨ q)?
Answer: De Morgan’s Law
Explanation: ¬p ∧ ¬q.

Q11.

Number of rows in truth table for 3 variables?
Answer: 8
Explanation: 2³ = 8.

Q12.

p → q is false when:
Answer: p=T, q=F
Explanation: Only false case.

Q13.

(p ∧ q) → p is:
Answer: Tautology
Explanation: If p∧q true, p must be true.

Q14.

Which connective has highest precedence?
Answer: ¬ (NOT)
Explanation: Evaluated first.

Q15.

If p is TRUE, ¬p is:
Answer: FALSE
Explanation: Definition of negation.

Q16.

(p → q) ∧ (q → p) equals:
Answer: p ↔ q
Explanation: Definition of biconditional.

Q17.

Which is logically equivalent to p ∨ q?
Answer: ¬(¬p ∧ ¬q)
Explanation: De Morgan’s law.

Q18.

If p ↔ q is FALSE, then:
Answer: p ≠ q
Explanation: Truth values differ.

Q19.

Which is a contingency?
Answer: p ∧ q
Explanation: Sometimes true, sometimes false.

Q20.

Value of ¬(TRUE)?
Answer: FALSE
Explanation: Negation rule.

Q21.

(p ∨ q) ∨ r is equivalent to:
Answer: p ∨ (q ∨ r)
Explanation: Associative law.

Q22.

Which law: p ∧ T = p
Answer: Identity law
Explanation: TRUE does not change AND.

Q23.

p ∨ F = ?
Answer: p
Explanation: Identity law for OR.

Q24.

p ∧ F = ?
Answer: FALSE
Explanation: Domination law.

Q25.

p ∨ T = ?
Answer: TRUE
Explanation: Domination law.

Q26.

Which removes double negation?
Answer: ¬(¬p) = p
Explanation: Double negation law.

Q27.

(p → q) ∨ (q → p) is:
Answer: Tautology
Explanation: Always at least one implication true.

Q28.

Which is logically strongest?
Answer: p ∧ q
Explanation: Requires both to be true.

Q29.

Which is weakest?
Answer: p ∨ q
Explanation: Only one true needed.

Q30.

Main GATE use of propositional logic?
Answer: Proofs, equivalence, reasoning
Explanation: Foundation for TOC & Discrete problems.
