📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Functions

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Clear, Strict, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Function?

A function f from set A to set B is a relation such that:

Every element of A is related to

Exactly one element of B

📌 Written as:
f : A → B

A → Domain

B → Codomain

Actual outputs → Range

📌 GATE Trap:
Every function is a relation, but not every relation is a function.

🔹 Function Condition (VERY IMPORTANT)

For f ⊆ A×B to be a function:

∀a ∈ A, one and only one (a,b) must exist

❌ One-to-many → NOT a function
✔️ Many-to-one → Allowed

🔹 Types of Functions (HIGH WEIGHTAGE)
1️⃣ One-to-One (Injective)

f(a₁) = f(a₂) ⇒ a₁ = a₂

📌 No two different inputs map to same output.

✔️ Example: f(x)=2x
❌ Example: f(x)=x² (over integers)

2️⃣ Onto (Surjective)

Range = Codomain

✔️ Every element of B has a pre-image.

📌 GATE Trap:
Codomain ≠ Range (check carefully).

3️⃣ Bijective

One-to-one

Onto

📌 Only bijective functions have inverses

🔹 Invertible Functions

A function f is invertible iff it is bijective.

f⁻¹ exists

f⁻¹ ∘ f = Identity

🔹 Composition of Functions

If f : A→B and g : B→C
Then (g∘f)(x) = g(f(x))

📌 GATE Trap:
Order matters → g∘f ≠ f∘g

🔹 Counting Functions (PYQ FAVORITE)

If |A| = m, |B| = n:

Total functions = nᵐ

One-to-one functions (m≤n): nPₘ

Onto functions: n! × S(m,n)
(S = Stirling number of 2nd kind)

📌 Usually GATE asks total functions only.

🔹 Special Functions

Identity function: f(x)=x

Constant function: f(x)=c
