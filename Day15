Now we move to Engineering Mathematics.

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Matrix Basics

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers:

𝐴=[𝑎𝑖𝑗]
A=[a
ij]

Size: m × n
m → rows
n → columns

🔹 Types of Matrices

Row matrix (1 × n)

Column matrix (m × 1)

Square matrix (n × n)

Zero matrix

Identity matrix (I)

Diagonal matrix

Symmetric matrix (A = Aᵀ)

Skew-symmetric (Aᵀ = −A)

📌 GATE Trap:
Diagonal entries of skew-symmetric matrix are always 0.

🔹 Matrix Operations
1️⃣ Addition

Only same order matrices.

2️⃣ Multiplication

If A is m×n and B is n×p
Result = m×p

📌 Matrix multiplication is NOT commutative.

🔹 Transpose

)

(A
T
)
ij
	​

=A
ji
	​


Properties:

(Aᵀ)ᵀ = A

(AB)ᵀ = BᵀAᵀ

🔹 Determinant (Very Important)

Defined only for square matrix.

For 2×2 matrix:

∣
𝑎
	
𝑏


𝑐
	
𝑑
∣
=
𝑎
𝑑
−
𝑏
𝑐
	​

a
c
	​

b
d
	​

	​

=ad−bc
🔹 Important Determinant Properties

1️⃣ Swap two rows → sign changes
2️⃣ Two identical rows → determinant = 0
3️⃣ Row multiple factor comes outside
4️⃣ Upper/lower triangular matrix → product of diagonal elements

📌 GATE Favorite:
Use row operations smartly.

🔹 Inverse of Matrix
𝐴
−
1
=
1
∣
𝐴
∣
adj
(
𝐴
)
A
−1
=
∣A∣
1
	​

adj(A)

Exists only if:

∣
𝐴
∣
≠
0
∣A∣

=0

📌 Determinant ≠ 0 → matrix is non-singular

🔹 Rank of Matrix

Rank = Maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns).

📌 Rank ≤ min(m,n)

🔹 System of Linear Equations

For AX = B:

Unique solution → det(A) ≠ 0

No solution → inconsistent

Infinite solutions → rank deficient

🔹 Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors (Introduction)

Eigenvalue λ satisfies:

∣
𝐴
−
𝜆
𝐼
∣
=
0
∣A−λI∣=0

📌 Characteristic equation.
