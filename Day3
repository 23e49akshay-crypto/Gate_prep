📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Relations

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Simple, Strict, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Relation?

A relation from set A to set B is a subset of A × B.

Cartesian Product:
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}

✔️ Example:
If A = {1,2}, B = {a,b}
A × B = {(1,a),(1,b),(2,a),(2,b)}

A relation R ⊆ A × B

🔹 Types of Relations (VERY IMPORTANT FOR GATE)

Let R be a relation on set A.

1️⃣ Reflexive

(a, a) ∈ R for all a ∈ A

✔️ Example: ≤ , ≥
❌ Example: <

📌 GATE Trap:
Reflexive depends on domain elements, not pairs count.

2️⃣ Symmetric

If (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R

✔️ Example: a = b
❌ Example: a < b

3️⃣ Antisymmetric

If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R ⇒ a = b

✔️ Example: ≤
📌 Trap:
Antisymmetric ≠ asymmetric

4️⃣ Transitive

If (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R

✔️ Example: ≤
❌ Example: “is parent of”

🔹 Special Relations (High Weightage)
✅ Equivalence Relation

A relation that is:

Reflexive

Symmetric

Transitive

✔️ Example: a ≡ b (mod n)

📌 GATE Favorite:
Number of equivalence classes = partition of set.

✅ Partial Order Relation (POSET)

A relation that is:

Reflexive

Antisymmetric

Transitive

✔️ Example: (P(S), ⊆), (N, ≤)

📌 Used heavily in lattices

🔹 Matrix & Graph Representation

Matrix: R[i][j] = 1 if (i,j) ∈ R

Directed Graph:
Nodes = elements
Edge a → b if (a,b) ∈ R

📌 GATE Trick:
Transitivity can be checked visually using paths.

🔹 Counting Relations

If |A| = n and |B| = m:

|A × B| = nm

Number of relations = 2ⁿᵐ
