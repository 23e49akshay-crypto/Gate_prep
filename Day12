📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Combinatorics – Permutations & Combinations

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Fundamental Counting Principle (FCP)

If:

Task 1 can be done in m ways

Task 2 can be done in n ways

Then total ways =

𝑚×𝑛
m×n

📌 Most basic but heavily used.

🔹 Permutations

Permutation = Arrangement matters

Number of ways to arrange r objects from n:

𝑛𝑃𝑟=𝑛!(𝑛−𝑟)!nP	​=(n−r)!n!
	​

Special Cases:

Arrange all n objects:

𝑛!n!

Circular permutation:

(𝑛−1)!(n−1)!

📌 GATE Trap:
For circular arrangements → reduce by 1.

🔹 Combinations

Combination = Selection only

𝑛𝐶𝑟=𝑛!𝑟!(𝑛)!n	​=r!(n−r)!n!
	​


📌 Key identity:

𝑛𝐶𝑟=𝑛𝐶𝑛−𝑟nCr	​=nCn−r
	​

🔹 Important Identities (Very Important)

1️⃣ Pascal’s Identity:

𝑛𝐶𝑟=𝑛−1𝐶𝑟−1+𝑛−1𝐶𝑟nCr	​=n−1Cr−1	​+n−1Cr
	​


2️⃣ Sum of all combinations:

\sum_{r=0}^{n} ^nC_r = 2^n
🔹 Combinations with Repetition
𝑛𝐶𝑟
 with repetition
=𝑛+𝑟−1𝐶𝑟nCr
	​

 with repetition=
n+r−1Cr
	​

🔹 Derangements (PYQ Favorite)

Number of permutations with no element in correct position:

!𝑛=𝑛!(1−11!+12!−13!+...)!n=n!(1−1!1	+21	​−3!1	​+...)

Approximation:

!𝑛≈𝑛!𝑒!n≈en!
	​

🔹 Multiset Permutations

If objects are repeated:

𝑛!𝑛1!𝑛2!𝑛3!..n1	​!n2	​!n3	​!...n!
	​


Example:
Word "LEVEL":

5!2!2!2!2!5!
	​

🔹 Important GATE Traps

Confusing permutation vs combination

Forgetting circular formula

Ignoring repetition condition
