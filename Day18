📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Calculus
🧠 Topic: Limits, Continuity & Differentiability

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Limit of a Function

The limit of f(x) as x → a is:

lim
⁡
𝑥→𝑎𝑓(𝑥)x→alim
	​

f(x)

Exists if:

Left-hand limit (LHL) = Right-hand limit (RHL)

(1+x)
1/x

📌 Extremely important for GATE.

🔹 Continuity

A function is continuous at x = a if:

f(a) exists

Limit exists

Limit = f(a)

Types of Discontinuity

Removable

Jump

Infinite

📌 GATE often asks piecewise continuity.

🔹 Differentiability

f(x) is differentiable at x = a if:

limℎ→0𝑓(𝑎+ℎ)−𝑓(𝑎)ℎh→0lim
	​

h
f(a+h)−f(a)
	​


exists.

Important Fact:

If differentiable → continuous
But continuous → NOT necessarily differentiable.

📌 Corner/cusp points are continuous but not differentiable.

🔹 Important Derivatives

d/dx (xⁿ) = nxⁿ⁻¹

d/dx (eˣ) = eˣ

d/dx (ln x) = 1/x

d/dx (sin x) = cos x

d/dx (cos x) = −sin x

🔹 Product Rule
(𝑓𝑔)′=𝑓′𝑔+𝑓𝑔′(fg)′=f′g+fg′
🔹 Chain Rule (VERY IMPORTANT)
𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑓(𝑔(𝑥))=𝑓′(𝑔(𝑥))𝑔z(𝑥)dxd
	​

f(g(x))=f
′
(g(x))g
′
(x)

📌 Heavy GATE usage.

🔹 L’Hospital’s Rule

For 0/0 or ∞/∞:

lim
⁡
𝑓(𝑥)𝑔(𝑥)=lim
⁡
𝑓′(𝑥)𝑔′(𝑥)limg(x)f(x)
	​

=limg′(x)f′(x)
	​

🔹 Maxima & Minima

Critical points when:

𝑓′(𝑥)=0f′(x)=0

Second derivative test:

f''(x) > 0 → Min

f''(x) < 0 → Max
