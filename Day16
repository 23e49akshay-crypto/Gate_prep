📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Linear Algebra
🧠 Topic: Vector Spaces & Linear Independence

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Vector Space

A vector space over a field F is a set V with:

Vector addition

Scalar multiplication

Satisfying 10 axioms (closure, associativity, distributive laws, etc.)

📌 For GATE: Focus on examples, subspaces, basis, dimension.

🔹 Examples of Vector Spaces

ℝⁿ

Polynomial space Pₙ

Set of all m×n matrices

Continuous functions

🔹 Subspace

A subset W of V is a subspace if:

Contains zero vector

Closed under addition

Closed under scalar multiplication

📌 Subspace Test (Very Important)

🔹 Linear Combination

Vector v is linear combination of v₁, v₂,…, vₙ if:

𝑣
=
𝑐
1
𝑣

+
𝑐

🔹 Linear Independence (VERY IMPORTANT)

Vectors v₁, v₂,…, vₙ are linearly independent if:

Otherwise → linearly dependent.

🔹 Key Results

If number of vectors > dimension → dependent

If determinant ≠ 0 → vectors independent

Rank equals maximum independent vectors

🔹 Basis

A set of vectors that:

Are linearly independent

Span the vector space

📌 Basis size = Dimension

🔹 Dimension

Number of vectors in any basis.

Example:

ℝ³ → dimension = 3

P₂ → dimension = 3

🔹 Row Space & Column Space

Row space dimension = Rank

Column space dimension = Rank

📌 Important theorem:
Row rank = Column rank

🔹 Null Space

Set of solutions to:

𝐴
𝑥
=
0
Ax=0

Dimension of null space = Nullity

Rank-Nullity Theorem:
