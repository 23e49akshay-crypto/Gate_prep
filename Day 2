📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Sets

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Simple & GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is a Set?

A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects.

✔️ Examples:

A = {1, 2, 3}

Vowels = {a, e, i, o, u}

❌ Not a set:

“Collection of good students” (not well-defined)

🔹 Types of Sets (VERY IMPORTANT)

Empty set (∅): No elements

Singleton set: One element

Finite set: Limited elements

Infinite set: Unlimited elements

Universal set (U): All possible elements

Subset (A ⊆ B): Every element of A is in B

Proper subset (A ⊂ B): A ⊆ B and A ≠ B

📌 GATE Trap:

∅ ⊆ A is always true

🔹 Set Operations
Operation	Symbol	Meaning
Union	A ∪ B	All elements of A or B
Intersection	A ∩ B	Common elements
Difference	A − B	In A but not in B
Complement	A′	Elements not in A
🔹 Important Laws (Frequently Asked)

Commutative: A ∪ B = B ∪ A

Associative: (A ∪ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∪ C)

Distributive: A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)

De Morgan’s Laws:

(A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′

(A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B′

📌 GATE Favorite: Apply De Morgan directly instead of drawing Venn diagrams.

🔹 Cardinality (Number of Elements)

n(A ∪ B) = n(A) + n(B) − n(A ∩ B)
