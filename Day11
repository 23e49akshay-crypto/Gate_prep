🧠 Topic: Isomorphism & Graph Isomorphism

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Strict, Clear, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 What is Graph Isomorphism?

Two graphs G₁(V₁, E₁) and G₂(V₂, E₂) are isomorphic if:

There exists a one-to-one and onto mapping

Between their vertex sets

That preserves adjacency

📌 In simple words:
Graphs are structurally identical, even if drawn differently.

🔹 Formal Definition

A function

𝑓
:
𝑉
1
→
𝑉
2
f:V
1
	​

→V
2
	​


Such that:

(
𝑢
,
𝑣
)
∈
𝐸
1
  
⟺
  
(
𝑓
(

)
,
𝑓
(
𝑣
)
)
∈
𝐸
2
(u,v)∈E
1
	​

⟺(f(u),f(v))∈E
2
	​


📌 Edges must correspond exactly.

🔹 Necessary Conditions for Isomorphism (VERY IMPORTANT)

If two graphs are isomorphic, they must have:

Same number of vertices

Same number of edges

Same degree sequence

Same number of connected components

Same number of cycles of each length

📌 GATE Trap:
These are necessary but NOT sufficient.

🔹 Degree Sequence Method (Most Common in GATE)

Steps:

Count degrees of all vertices

Arrange in non-increasing order

Compare sequences

If sequences differ → NOT isomorphic.

🔹 Adjacency Matrix Method

Two graphs are isomorphic if:
Their adjacency matrices are the same under permutation of rows & columns.

📌 Used in theoretical questions.

🔹 Important Notes

Isomorphic graphs have:

Same chromatic number

Same number of spanning trees

Same number of triangles

Drawing style does NOT matter.

🔹 Automorphism

An automorphism is an isomorphism of a graph to itself.

📌 Symmetric graphs have many automorphisms.
