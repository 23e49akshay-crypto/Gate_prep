📚 Subject: Engineering Mathematics – Discrete Mathematics
🧠 Topic: Partial Orders & Lattices

1️⃣ Concept Teaching (Clear, Strict, GATE-Oriented)
🔹 Partial Order Relation

A relation R on a set A is a partial order if it is:

Reflexive → (a, a) ∈ R

Antisymmetric → (a, b) and (b, a) ⇒ a = b

Transitive → (a, b) and (b, c) ⇒ (a, c)

📌 Such a set is called a POSET (Partially Ordered Set).

✔️ Examples:

(N, ≤)

(P(A), ⊆)

(Divisibility, |)

❌ Not POSET:

“<” (not reflexive)

“=” (not antisymmetric issue? No order growth)

🔹 Comparable vs Incomparable Elements

In a POSET:

a and b are comparable if a ≤ b or b ≤ a

Otherwise → incomparable

📌 GATE Trap:
Partial order ≠ total order

🔹 Total (Linear) Order

A POSET is a total order if every pair of elements is comparable.

✔️ Example:

(N, ≤)

❌ Example:

(P({1,2}), ⊆)

🔹 Hasse Diagram (VERY IMPORTANT)

A Hasse diagram is a simplified graphical representation of a POSET.

Rules:

Draw elements as nodes

Draw edge a → b if:

a < b

No intermediate element exists

Remove self-loops & transitive edges

Higher elements drawn upward

📌 GATE Favorite:
Drawing correct Hasse diagram from a relation.

🔹 Minimal, Maximal, Least, Greatest

Minimal element: No element smaller than it

Maximal element: No element greater than it

Least element: Smaller than all

Greatest element: Greater than all

📌 Traps:

Least/Greatest → unique

Minimal/Maximal → can be many

🔹 Lattice

A POSET (L, ≤) is a lattice if every pair (a,b) has:

Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) → Meet (a ∧ b)

Least Upper Bound (LUB) → Join (a ∨ b)

📌 Key condition:
Both meet & join must exist for every pair

✔️ Example:

(P(A), ⊆) is always a lattice

🔹 Properties of Lattice Operations

For all a, b, c ∈ L:

Commutative: a ∨ b = b ∨ a

Associative: a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c

Idempotent: a ∨ a = a

Absorption: a ∨ (a ∧ b) = a

📌 GATE Trap:
Absorption law is often forgotten.

🔹 Special Lattices
1️⃣ Bounded Lattice

Has:

Least element (0)

Greatest element (1)

2️⃣ Distributive Lattice

a ∧ (b ∨ c) = (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)

✔️ (P(A), ⊆) is distributive
